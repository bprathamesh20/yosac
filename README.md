# Yosac - Your Overseas Study Advisor & Counsellor

Yosac is an intelligent agent designed to assist students in planning their overseas education. It acts as a personalized college counsellor, helping students navigate the complex process of shortlisting universities and programs that align with their academic profiles, scores, and preferences.

## Key Features

-   **Personalized Shortlisting:** Yosac can generate tailored university shortlists (Safe, Target, Ambitious) based on individual student profiles, including academic scores, test results (like GRE, TOEFL), and program interests.
-   **In-depth Research:** Leverages a suite of specialized research tools to provide comprehensive information about universities, programs, and related requirements.

## Deep Research Tools

Yosac utilizes a collection of "Deep Research Tools" to gather and present detailed information. These tools are activated based on the user's query to provide the most relevant results:

### 1. `deep-research`

-   **Purpose:** Used for researching specific topics, details, or general information related to studying abroad. This can include information on colleges, scholarships, visa requirements, cost of living, etc.
-   **When to use:** When the query requires in-depth or detailed research beyond general knowledge or simple facts.

### 2. `university-research`

-   **Purpose:** Specifically designed for researching universities.
-   **When to use:**
    -   When asked about top universities for a particular course or in general within a country.
    -   When the user requests a list or comparison of universities based on rankings or reputation.
-   **Example Queries:**
    -   "Best universities for computer science in the USA"
    -   "Top universities for business in the UK"
    -   "Universities for medicine in Germany"

### 3. `program-research`

-   **Purpose:** Focuses on researching specific academic programs at universities.

    -   "What is the application process for the PhD program at MIT?"

### 4. `compare-program`

-   **Purpose:** Used for directly comparing two academic programs.
-   **When to use:** When the user explicitly requests a comparison between two programs.
